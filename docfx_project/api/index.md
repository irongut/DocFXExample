# DocFX Example

A simple .NET Standard 2.1 Class Library with a single class `Example` which contains a single method `Divide`.

This class library is just an example to demonstrate using DocFX with GitHub Actions to build and publish a documentation site. It accompanies my blog post [Document your .NET code with DocFX and GitHub Actions](https://blog.taranissoftware.com/document-your-net-code-with-docfx-and-github-actions).
